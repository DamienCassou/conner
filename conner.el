;;; Commentary:

;; Conner is a Command Runner for GNU Emacs.
;;
;; Conner allows you to define arbitrary commands for each of your
;; projects.  Every project could have a different way to compile it,
;; to run it, to test it, to prettify it, to watch for changes, to
;; debug it, to install it, or any other thing.  With conner, you can
;; define a command for each of these actions, or any other you want.
;;
;; Commands are defined in the conner file, by default called .conner,
;; situated at the root of your project.  Inside it, you'll find a Lisp
;; object that contains a list of command names, and the commands
;; themselves.
;;
;; Conner also provides a multitude of functions to add, delete,
;; update, and of course, run these commands from within Emacs.  It
;; integrates with project.el, so you can run these commands on
;; arbitrary folders, or have it automatically detect the current
;; project's root.
;;
;; Additionally, conner also has support for .env files.  By default,
;; conner will look in the root directory of your project for a .env
;; file and load any environment variables found within.  These
;; variables are then accessible to conner commands, and won't pollute
;; the regular Emacs session.
